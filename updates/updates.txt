DTWAIN-Java Version changes

Version 1.7.1 

- Update JNI DLL's to be compatible with DTWAIN 5.6.3.  

- In com.dtwain.demos.fulldemo, ensure TWAIN is shut-down properly when closing the demo program
  by clicking the "X" (close) button on the GUI.

- Update dtwain-java jar file to dtwain-java-1.7.jar.  


Version 1.7 (JNI code changes only)

Update JNI DLL's to be compatible with DTWAIN 5.6.2.  No java manifest files were updated.


Version 1.6

- Ensure proper handling of ANSI strings when calling capability functions that require strings.

- Fix issue with capabilityInterface.setCapValues() ignoring the capability and data type settings.


Version 1.5

- Allow application to prioritize and enable/disable scanning options and capabilities in the 
  OptionsApplyer class.

- Add AutoScanningOptions() to OptionsApplyer.

- Add missing flip-rotation and other options to OptionApplyer.

- Set certain AcquireCharacteristics values to proper TWAIN default values.


Version 1.4

- Add ExtendedImageInfo.java to allow retrieval of extended image information such as barcode text
  and positioning, imprinter text, line speckle removal, etc.  See the TWEI_... constants and
  definitions in the TWAIN 2.x specification for more information.

- Added ExtendedImageInfoDemo.java to demonstrate usage of the ExtendedImageInfo class.

- Updated BarcodeDemo.java to output the information on the barcodes that have been found on the 
  acquired page.  Note that your device must support barcode retrieval, and support extended image
  information that will report barcode information (see update above).

- The dtwainjni.info file has been updated.  You must use this updated dtwainjni.info file with 
  version 1.4 of DTWAIN-Java, as any earlier versions of dtwainjni.info will not work (an 
  exception will be thrown back to Java if the file is not valid).  

- You must use the DTWAIN DLL's (dtwain32u.dll, dtwain64u.dll, etc.) that are of version 5.5.4 or higher.  
  Earlier versions of DTWAIN will not work correctly with version 1.4 of DTWAIN_Java.


Version 1.3

- Fix issue with JNI layer not maintaining global class object for logger and callback Java classes.

- C++/JNI layer no longer has the requirement for DTWAIN import libraries to be used when building
  the JNI DLL's.
